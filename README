TO START website YOU NEED ".ENV" FILE IN MAIN DIRECTORY WITH JUST 3 PARAMETERS:
ADMINS=<YOUR EMAIL>
MAIL_USERNAME=<GOOGLE_EMAIL_TO_SEND_MESSAGES>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD_TO_SEND_MESSAGES>

Example:
ADMINS=INESS0@Yahoo.com
MAIL_USERNAME=Pythonmessanger@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=itsnotrealpasswordtho


With .env being created all you need is dto write in "docker compose up" in our console.
(Obviously, you need docker installed on you system)
